#  About Me:
I am currently in my fourth year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology. My academic journey has encompassed a diverse range of technical subjects, including programming, database management, and web development. This coursework has equipped me with robust analytical, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills, attributes I believe would be invaluable to any organization I have the privilege to work with.
